Here is a great full stack project to re-create a nice platform, Twitter (mine is called Feeli after my lastname Alfeel -> Feeli which means the elephant :)  Built with the tech stack: MongoDB, Express Nodejs and React and Cloudinary for storing images :) 

Visit: Feeli.onrender.com 

It might take a minute for the twitter clone to get loaded :)
